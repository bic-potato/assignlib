# Assignment \#2

## A. Watermelon

One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in there opinion. After the watermelon was weighted, and the scales showed *w* kilos. They rushed home,dying of thirst and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weights even number of kilos,at the same time it is  not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys  are extremely tired and wanted to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want.  For sure, each of them should get a positive part of weight.

## A.  Way Too Long Words

Sometimes some words like "localization" or "internationalization" are so long that writing them many times in one text are quite tiresome. 

Let's consider a word *too long*, if its length is **strictly more** than 10 characters. All too long words should be replaced with a special abbreviation.

This abbreviation is made like this: we write down the first and the last letter of a word and between them we write the number of letters between the first and the last letters. That number is in decimal system and doesn't contain any leading zeros.

Thus, "localization" will be spelt as "l10n", and "internationalization" will be spelt as "i18n".

You are suggested to automatize the process of changing the words with abbreviations. At that all too long words should be replaced by the abbreviation and the words that are not too long should not undergo any changes.

 ## A. Team

One day three best friends Petya, Vasya and Tonya decided to form a team and take part in programming contests. Participates are usually offered several problems during   programming contests. Long before the start the friends decided that they will implement a problem if at least two of them sure about the solution. 

This contest offers *n* problems to the participants. For each of problem we know, which friend is sure about the solution. Help the friends find the number of problems for which they will write a solution.

## A. Next Round

"Contestant who earns a score equal to or greater than the *k*-th place finisher's score will advance to the next round, as long as the contestant earns a positive score..."-an excerpt from contest rules.

A total of *n* participants took part in the contest(*n≥k*), and you already know their scores. Calculate how many participants will advance to the next round.

## A. Domino pilling

You are given a rectangular board of *M×N*  squares. Also you are given an unlimited number of standard domino pieces of 2×1 squares. You are allowed to rotate the pieces. You are asked to place as many dominoes as possible on the board so as to meet the following conditions:

1.  Each domino completely covers two squares.
2. No two dominoes overlap.
3. Each domino lies entirely It is allowed to touch the edges of the board. Find the maximum number of dominoes, which can be placed under these restrictions.

## A. Beautiful Matrix

You've got a 5×5 matrix, consisting of 24 zeroes and a single number one. Let's index the matrix rows by numbers from 1 to 5 from left to right. In one move, you are allowed to apply one of the two following transformations to the martix:

1. Swap two neighboring matrix rows, that is, rows with index *i* and *i+*1 for some integer (1 ≤ *i* < 5).
2. Swap two neighboring matrix columns, that is, columns with indexes *j* and *j* + 1 for some integer *j* (1 ≤ *j* < 5).

You think that a matrix looks *beautiful*, if the single number one of the matrix is located in its middle (in the cell that is on the intersection of the third row and the third column). Count the minimum number of moves needed to make the matrix beautiful.

## A. Helpful Maths

Xenia the beginner mathematician is a third year student at elementary school. She is now learning the addition operation.

The teacher has written down the sum of multiple numbers. Pupils  should calculate the sum. To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains numbers 1,2 and 3. Still, that isn't enough for Xenia. She is only beginning to count, so she can calculate a sum only if the summands follow in non-decreasing order. For example, she can't calculate 1+3+2+1 but she can calculate 1+1+2 and 3+3.

You have got the sum that was written on the board. Rearrange the summands and print the sum in such a way that Xenia can calculate the sum.

## A. Word Capitalization

Capitalization is writing a word with its first letter as a capital letter. Your task is to capitalize the given word.

Note, that capitalization all the letters except the first one remains unchanged.

## A. Stones on the Table

There are *n* stones on the table in a row, each of them can be red, green or blue. Count the minimum number of the stones to take from the table so that any two neighboring stones had different colors. Stones in a row are considered neighboring if there are no other stones between them.

## A. Boy or Girl

Those days, many boys use beautiful girls' photos as avatars in forums. So it is pretty hard to tell the gender of a user at the first glance. Last year, our hero went to a forum and had a nice chat with a beauty (he thought so). After that they talked very often and eventually they became a couple in the network.

But yesterday, he came to see "her" in the real world and found out "she" is actually a very strong man! Our hero is very sad and he is too tired to love again now. So he came up with a way to recognize users' genders by their user names.

This is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd, then he is a male, otherwise she is a female. You are given the string that denotes the user name, please help our hero to determine the gender of this user by his method.

## A. Soldier and Bananas

A soldier wants to buy *w* bananas in the shop. He has to pay *k* dollars for the first banana, 2*k* dollars for the second one and so on (in other words, he has to pay *i*·*k* dollars for the *i*-th banana).

He has *n* dollars. How many dollars does he have to borrow from his friend soldier to buy *w* bananas?

## A. Bear and Big Brother

Bear Limak wants to become the largest of bears, or at least to become larger than his brother Bob.

Right now, Limak and Bob weigh *a* and *b* respectively. It's guaranteed that Limak's weight is smaller than or equal to his brother's weight.

Limak eats a lot and his weight is tripled after every year, while Bob's weight is doubled after every year.

After how many full years will Limak become strictly larger (strictly heavier) than Bob?

## A. Tram

Linear Kingdom has exactly one tram line. It has *n* stops, numbered from 1 to *n* in the order of tram's movement. At the *i*-th stop *a i* passengers exit the tram, while *b i* passengers enter it. The tram is empty before it arrives at the first stop. Also, when the tram arrives at the last stop, all passengers exit so that it becomes empty.

Your task is to calculate the tram's minimum capacity such that the number of people inside the tram at any time never exceeds this capacity. Note that at each stop all exiting passengers exit **before** any entering passenger enters the tram.

## A. Wrong Subtraction

Little girl Tanya is learning how to decrease a number by one, but she does it wrong with a number consisting of two or more digits. Tanya subtracts one from a number by the following algorithm:

- if the last digit of the number is non-zero, she decreases the number by one;
- if the last digit of the number is zero, she divides the number by 10 (i.e. removes the last digit).

You are given an integer number *n*. Tanya will subtract one from it *k* times. Your task is to print the result after all *k* subtractions.

It is guaranteed that the result will be positive integer number.

## A. Elephant

An elephant decided to visit his friend. It turned out that the elephant's house is located at point 0 and his friend's house is located at point *x*(*x* > 0) of the coordinate line. In one step the elephant can move 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 positions forward. Determine, what is the minimum number of steps he need to make in order to get to his friend's house.

## B. Queue at the School

During the break the schoolchildren, boys and girls, formed a queue of *n* people in the canteen. Initially the children stood in the order they entered the canteen. However, after a while the boys started feeling awkward for standing in front of the girls in the queue and they started letting the girls move forward each second.

Let's describe the process more precisely. Let's say that the positions in the queue are sequentially numbered by integers from 1 to *n*, at that the person in the position number 1 is served first. Then, if at time *x* a boy stands on the *i*-th position and a girl stands on the (*i* + 1)-th position, then at time *x* + 1 the *i*-th position will have a girl and the (*i* + 1)-th position will have a boy. The time is given in seconds.

You've got the initial position of the children, at the initial moment of time. Determine the way the queue is going to look after *t* seconds.

## A. Nearly Lucky Number

Petya loves lucky numbers. We all know that lucky numbers are the positive integers whose decimal representations contain only the lucky digits **4** and **7**. For example, numbers **47**, **744**, **4** are lucky and **5**, **17**, **467** are not.

Unfortunately, not all numbers are lucky. Petya calls a number nearly lucky if the number of lucky digits in it is a lucky number. He wonders whether number *n* is a nearly lucky number.

## A. Word

Vasya is very upset that many people on the Net mix uppercase and lowercase letters in one word. That's why he decided to invent an extension for his favorite browser that would change the letters' register in every word so that it either only consisted of lowercase letters or, vice versa, only of uppercase ones. At that as little as possible letters should be changed in the word. For example, the word HoUse must be replaced with house, and the word ViP — with VIP. If a word contains an equal number of uppercase and lowercase letters, you should replace all the letters with lowercase ones. For example, maTRIx should be replaced by matrix. Your task is to use the given method on one given word.

## A. Translation

The translation from the Berland language into the Birland language is not an easy task. Those languages are very similar: a berlandish word differs from a birlandish word with the same meaning a little: it is spelled (and pronounced) reversely. For example, a Berlandish word code corresponds to a Birlandish word `edoc`. However, it's easy to make a mistake during the «translation». Vasya translated word *s* from Berlandish into Birlandish as *t*. Help him: find out if he translated the word correctly.

## A. Anton and Danik

Anton likes to play chess, and so does his friend Danik.

Once they have played *n* games in a row. For each game it's known who was the winner — Anton or Danik. None of the games ended with a tie.

Now Anton wonders, who won more games, he or Danik? Help him determine this.

## A. George and Accommodation

George has recently entered the BSUCP (Berland State University for Cool Programmers). George has a friend Alex who has also entered the university. Now they are moving into a dormitory.

George and Alex want to live in the same room. The dormitory has *n* rooms in total. At the moment the *i*-th room has *p~i~* people living in it and the room can accommodate *q~i~* people in total (*p~i~* ≤ *q~i~*). Your task is to count how many rooms has free place for both George and Alex.

## A. Beautiful Year

It seems like the year of 2013 came only yesterday. Do you know a curious fact? The year of 2013 is the first year after the old 1987 with only distinct digits.

Now you are suggested to solve the following problem: given a year number, find the minimum year number which is strictly larger than the given one and has only distinct digits.

## A. Presents

Little Petya very much likes gifts. Recently he has received a new laptop as a New Year gift from his mother. He immediately decided to give it to somebody else as what can be more pleasant than giving somebody gifts. And on this occasion he organized a New Year party at his place and invited *n* his friends there.

If there's one thing Petya likes more that receiving gifts, that's watching others giving gifts to somebody else. Thus, he safely hid the laptop until the next New Year and made up his mind to watch his friends exchanging gifts while he does not participate in the process. He numbered all his friends with integers from 1 to *n*. Petya remembered that a friend number *i* gave a gift to a friend number *p~i~*. He also remembered that each of his friends received exactly one gift.

Now Petya wants to know for each friend *i* the number of a friend who has given him a gift.

## A. Vanya and Fence

Vanya and his friends are walking along the fence of height *h* and they do not want the guard to notice them. In order to achieve this the height of each of the friends should not exceed *h*. If the height of some person is greater than *h* he can bend down and then he surely won't be noticed by the guard. The height of the *i*-th person is equal to *a~i~*.

Consider the width of the person walking as usual to be equal to 1, while the width of the bent person is equal to 2. Friends want to talk to each other while walking, so they would like to walk in a single row. What is the minimum width of the road, such that friends can walk in a row and remain unattended by the guard?

## A. Magnets

Mad scientist Mike entertains himself by arranging rows of dominoes. He doesn't need dominoes, though: he uses rectangular magnets instead. Each magnet has two poles, positive (a "plus") and negative (a "minus"). If two magnets are put together at a close distance, then the like poles will repel each other and the opposite poles will attract each other.

Mike starts by laying one magnet horizontally on the table. During each following step Mike adds one more magnet horizontally to the right end of the row. Depending on how Mike puts the magnet on the table, it is either attracted to the previous one (forming a group of multiple magnets linked together) or repelled by it (then Mike lays this magnet at some distance to the right from the previous one). We assume that a sole magnet not linked to others forms a group of its own.

Mike arranged multiple magnets in a row. Determine the number of groups that the magnets formed.

## A. In Search of an Easy Problem

When preparing a tournament, Codeforces coordinators try treir best to make the first problem as easy as possible. This time the coordinator had chosen some problem and asked *n* people about their opinions. Each person answered whether this problem is easy or hard.

If at least one of these *n* people has answered that the problem is hard, the coordinator decides to change the problem. For the given responses, check if the problem is easy enough.

## A. Hulk

Dr. Bruce Banner hates his enemies (like others don't). As we all know, he can barely talk when he turns into the incredible Hulk. That's why he asked you to help him to express his feelings.

Hulk likes the Inception so much, and like that his feelings are complicated. They have *n* layers. The first layer is hate, second one is love, third one is hate and so on...

For example if *n* = 1, then his feeling is `"I hate it"` or if *n* = 2 it's `"I hate that I love it"`, and if *n* = 3 it's `"I hate that I love that I hate it"` and so on.

Please help Dr. Banner.

## A. Calculating Function

For a positive integer *n* let's define a function *f* :

$$
f(n) =  -1 + 2 - 3 + .. + ( - 1)^nn
$$

Your task is to calculate *f*(*n*) for a given integer *n*.

## A. Ultra-Fast Mathematician

Shapur was an extremely gifted student. He was great at everything including Combinatorics, Algebra, Number Theory, Geometry, Calculus, etc. He was not only smart but extraordinarily fast! He could manage to sum 1018 numbers in a single second.

One day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.

In his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The *i*-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the *i*-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the *i*-th digit of the answer is 0.

Shapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length ∞ (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.

Now you are going to take part in Shapur's contest. See if you are faster and more accurate.
